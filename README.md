Auther : Roaa Mustafa
I take from me 3 hours 
 Overview:
 Game that take a text from user and create a text file with a atext included the words that he insert it 
 usind read write functions
 parse function
 merge function
 and function to let user add whzat he want 

 ## steps:
 Create a file called madlib.py at root of madlib_cli folder, which will contain all of the Python code that you will write relating to your Madlib game.
Keeping in mind the concept of Single Responsibility Principle, build a command line tool which will perform the following:
Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
Prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct position within the template.
After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo).
Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.
